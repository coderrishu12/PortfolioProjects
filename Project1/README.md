<h1>Data Cleaning Methodology for Housing Data</h1>
  <p>This repository presents a structured methodology for cleaning and preparing real-world housing data for analysis, covering crucial tasks such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Standardizing date formats</li>
    <li>Handling missing values</li>
    <li>Splitting address fields</li>
    <li>Converting data types</li>
    <li>Removing duplicates</li>
    <li>Deleting unnecessary columns</li>
    <li>Importing data</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Key components of this repository include:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SQL scripts for each cleaning step</li>
    <li>Clear comments explaining the purpose of each code block</li>
    <li>A sample dataset named "Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.xlsx"</li>
    <li>Instructions on how to execute the provided code</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This project is particularly beneficial for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data analysts and scientists aiming to hone their data cleaning skills</li>
    <li>Individuals interested in exploring Nashville housing data</li>
    <li>Learners seeking practical experience with SQL for data manipulation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key takeaways from this project include:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding common data cleaning challenges and effective solutions</li>
    <li>Proficiency in writing SQL queries for data preparation</li>
    <li>Developing a systematic approach to cleanse datasets</li>
    <li>Gaining insights into trends and patterns within housing data</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The project specifically focuses on cleaning and standardizing data within the "NashvilleHousing" table. Initially, it addresses the SaleDate field by converting it into a consistent date format and updating the table accordingly. Missing PropertyAddress values are populated by leveraging ParcelID matches through a self-join operation.</p>

  <p>Further refinement involves parsing address fields (PropertyAddress and OwnerAddress) into distinct columns for address, city, and state components using string manipulation functions. The boolean field SoldAsVacant undergoes transformation to display 'Yes' for 'Y' and 'No' for 'N'. Duplicates within the table are identified and managed by retaining only unique records based on specified criteria.</p>

  <p>Finally, unnecessary columns (OwnerAddress, TaxDistrict, PropertyAddress, SaleDate) are removed to streamline the dataset, enhancing its usability for subsequent analysis and reporting endeavors.</p>
